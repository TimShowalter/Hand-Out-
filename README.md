# Hand-Out-
Donation Delivery Service 

The need for food and clothing donations is dramatically increasing daily all over the world. 
Although there are many new ways to attain these donated items, we have innovated a new way of distribution. 
By filling out an application on our user-friendly website, we are able to gather information about the donation of your choosing. 
After gathering this information, we will then send a volunteer to pick up your items and head to a local charity soup kitchen. 
This is where we will soft the items and present them to those in need of your donations.
